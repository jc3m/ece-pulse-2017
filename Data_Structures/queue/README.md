# Queue (8 points)

## Instructions
Using one of the following languages (C/C++, Python, Java) implement a queue using a stack.

Internal libraries are allowed for the stack data structure.

The queue must support the following operations:

* Enqueue
	* Add an item to the back of the queue 
* Dequeue
	* Remove an item from the front of the queue
* Front
	* View the item at the front of the queue

Assume that the data structure will only hold `ints`.

Provide instructions on how to test your data structure.
